News Explorer is a desktop application developed in Python that provides a streamlined interface for 
accessing and reading the latest news articles from various categories. The application uses Tkinter for 
its graphical user interface (GUI) and fetches news data through the GoogleNews API, offering users an 
organized way to stay updated on current events. The program features a tab-based layout, allowing 
users to browse news by specific regions by topics like technology, renewable energy, and current 
affairs. The applicationâ€™s structure also supports future expansion, making it adaptable for additional 
features or categories.
